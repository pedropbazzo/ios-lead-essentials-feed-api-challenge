It's time to put your skills to the test!

You are called to implement the `RemoteFeedLoader` to load a collection of images from a backend.

Your implementation must:

1) Conform to the `<FeedLoader>` protocol creating an array of `FeedImage`:

2) Follow the backend contract below:

### Remote Feed Image Spec

| Property      | Type                |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `image_id`    | `UUID`              |
| `image_desc`  | `String` (optional) |
| `image_loc`   | `String` (optional) |
| `image_url`	| `URL`               |

### Payload contract

## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to get you used to the TDD flow.

We've provided you with appropriate tests to guide and validate your solution. You need to make all the tests pass, one by one, by implementing the `load` method in the existing `RemoteFeedLoader` class.

1) Fork the latest version of the challenge repo. Here's <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking" target="_blank">how forking works</a>.

2) Open the `FeedAPIChallenge.xcodeproj` project on Xcode 12.4 (you can use other Xcode versions by switching to the appropriate branch, e.g., `xcode11`, `xcode12`, `xcode12_2`, `xcode12_3`).

3) There are two main folders in the project:
	- The `FeedAPIChallenge` folder contains the production types, including the `RemoteFeedLoader` and dependencies for requesting and loading the feed remotely. 

		- ⚠️ Important: ***You should only change the `RemoteFeedLoader.swift` file to implement the `load` method.***
	
	- The `Tests` folder contains the test cases. 

		- ⚠️ Important: ***You should only change the `LoadFeedFromRemoteUseCaseTests.swift` file to implement all test cases.***

	- Do not change the indentation in the project.

	- Do not rename the existing classes and files.

4) Use the `Tests/LoadFeedFromRemoteUseCaseTests.swift` to validate your implementation. 

	- Uncomment (CMD+/) and implement one test at a time following the TDD process: 
		- Make the test pass, commit, and move to the next one.

	- While developing your solutions, run all tests with CMD+U. 

5) Errors should be handled accordingly.
	- There shouldn't be *any* force-unwrap `!` or `fatalError` in production code.

	- There shouldn't be empty `catch` blocks.

	- There shouldn't be any `print` statements, such as `print(error)`.

6) When all tests are passing and you're done implementing your solution:

	- Create a Pull Request from your branch to the main challenge repo's matching branch.

		- For example, if you implemented the challenge using the `xcode12_4` branch, your PR should be from your fork's `xcode12_4` branch into the main repo's `xcode12_4` branch (DO NOT MIX Xcode versions or you'll have merge conflicts!).

	- The title of the Pull Request should be: **Your Name - Feed API Challenge**.

7) Post a comment in the challenge page in the academy with the link to your PR, so we can review your solution and provide feedback.


## Guidelines

1) Aim to commit your changes every time you add/alter the behavior of your system or refactor your code.

2) Aim for descriptive commit messages that clarify the intent of your contribution which will help other developers understand your train of thought and purpose of changes.

3) The system should always be in a green state, meaning that in each commit all tests should be passing.

4) The project should build without warnings.

5) The code should be carefully organized and easy to read (e.g. indentation must be consistent).

6) Make careful and proper use of access control, marking as `private` any implementation details that aren’t referenced from other external components.

7) Aim to write self-documenting code by providing context and detail when naming your components, avoiding explanations in comments.

Happy coding!
